# odin-recipes Project

This is the curriculum's first project. In this project, I used skills from the curriculum such as setting up a GitHub repository, understanding the Git workflow, navigating the terminal, and creating directories and files.

Along with that, I was able to create a simple html website that is easy to read by utilising input headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, links, and images.
