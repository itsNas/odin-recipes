    <p>While <strong><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7711/Karigurashi_no_Arrietty?q=arietty&cat=anime">The Secret World of Arrietty</a></strong>  didn’t show a recipe for this dish on screen, many fans have surmised that it is a classic Japanese cream stew. Made with vegetables and a milk-based roux, this heart-warming stew is best served hot on a cold day. For an even heartier dish, you can add chicken or pork cubes.</p>
